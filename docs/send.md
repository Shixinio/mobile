# Sending Burstcoins

The Android Burstcoin Wallet Application allows you to send Burstcoins to other addresses. Sending Burstcoins is only possible with an active account. If you have imported an offline account and want to send Burstcoins, please refer to [Activate Account](wallet/activate.md).

## Send

In order to send Burst to another address, you have to enter:

1. A valid Burst address as recipient
2. An amount less or equal to your current balance
3. A transaction fee of a minimum of 1 Burstcoin

## Verify

For your transaction to actually take place, you have to verify your transaction by entering the [PIN code](pin.md) of your account. Otherwise, the transaction cannot be executed.
